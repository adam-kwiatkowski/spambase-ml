# Spambase ML
I've created this project to learn more about the deployment of machine learning models. The project is a simple API that takes in an email and returns a prediction of whether it is spam or not spam. The model is trained using the Spambase dataset available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase).


This repository is divided into two parts, the frontend and the backend. The frontend is a simple Vue 3 app that allows you to enter an email and get a prediction. The backend is a FastAPI app that contains the model and the endpoint to make predictions.

Informations about the API and training the model can be found in the [backend README](backend/README.md).

## Running the web app
